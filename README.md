Hi Morty!

UI Engineering Coding Assignment

<br><br>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and follows the
technical requirements outlined in the assignment sheet.

To launch this project, navigate to the root of this project with the package.json file and run in the command line either:
### `npm start`
or
### `npm run build`

<br><br>

Over the allotted 3 hours, I was able to fully complete the first two sections on top of the light architecting of this code base, the creation of each component and development of as much reusable sass as possible, the writing of the jsx, and some light content population to match the designs as much as possible.

<br><br>

The rest of the development of this page should move very quickly since I invested upfront in clean, reusable code.

<br><br>

The completed components are fully responsive, although maybe not pixel perfect which was a choice to avoid in observing the 3-hour time limit.  

<br><br>

Copy/pasted directions for build commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
